# viTScratch
This project implements the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture from the seminal research paper "An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale". The goal is to reproduce the ViT model design and training pipeline to gain hands-on experience with transformer-based image classification.
